If it's created by jeeva, it wil go away with the knowledge. Just like rope-snake that will disappear with the wake knowledge of the rope. The snake is <strong>arthaadhyaasa</strong>, error of object. The body which is ishwara's creation is <strong>gyaanaadhyaasa</strong>, error of knowledge. (Even after knowing sun does not move, sun will be seen rising and setting). Similarly physical body will continue to exist till prarabdha lasts. When we say body is ishwara's creation it is not given by him according to his whims and fancies but <strong>in keeping with the law of karma</strong>.<br><br>Explaination - <br><br></em></p><p>The concept is explained that even after attaining spiritual enlightenment or "gnyana," the physical body of an individual, known as the "jeeva" body, does not disappear immediately. This is elucidated through the analogy of the rope and the snake.</p><ol><li><p>Creation by Ishwara: According to Vedanta, the physical body is created by Ishwara, the divine aspect of existence. It is viewed as part of the cosmic order and is governed by the laws of karma. Therefore, the body should be allowed to naturally run its course until the end of its predetermined lifespan, known as "<strong>prarabdha</strong>."</p></li><li><p><strong>Gyanaadhyaasa </strong>and <strong>Arthaadhyaasa</strong>: The persistence of the body even after attaining spiritual enlightenment is explained through the concepts of "gyanaadhyaasa" and "arthaadhyaasa." "Arthaadhyaasa" refers to the error of object perception, as in mistaking a rope for a snake. In contrast, "gyanaadhyaasa" refers to the error of knowledge, where despite knowing the truth, the perception or experience remains unchanged.</p></li><li><p>Example of the Rope-Snake Analogy: Just as the illusion of the snake persists even after realizing the rope's true nature, the physical body continues to exist even after gaining spiritual knowledge. The disappearance of the snake upon realizing the rope represents the resolution of the error of object perception. Similarly, the physical body's existence is seen as a manifestation of the divine order, which continues until the individual's predetermined karma is exhausted.</p></li><li><p>Law of Karma: The creation of the body by Ishwara is not arbitrary but follows the law of karma. Each individual's experiences, including the physical body, are shaped by past actions and karmic debts. Therefore, the body's existence is governed by laws rather than divine whim.</p></li></ol><p><em> </em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://advaitavedanta.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://advaitavedanta.github.io/upadhi-upahitam.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> upAdhi / upAhitam</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://advaitavedanta.github.io/swabhavik-agantuk-guna.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Swabhavik / Agantuk Guna </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://advaitavedanta.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>All rights reserved</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://advaitavedanta.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://advaitavedanta.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

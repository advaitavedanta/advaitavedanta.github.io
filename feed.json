It persists until displaced by knowledge. Agyaan shouldn't be misconstrued as a lack of knowledge because mere absence (\"abhaava\") doesn't lead to issues. Problems arise from presence, or \"bhaava,\" not absence. Thus, agyaan isn't the absence of knowledge, or \"gyaan abhaava.\" Ignorance opposes knowledge and, being problematic, holds significance as long as it persists. However, in the presence of knowledge, it ceases to exist.</p>\n<p>Similarly to how darkness dissipates in the presence of light, ignorance vanishes in the presence of knowledge. Ignorance has a tangible existence, or \"bhaava,\" causing errors and troubles. For instance, mistaking a rope for a snake due to ignorance induces fear. Likewise, in dreams, ignorance about the true self leads to perplexing scenarios, such as a millionaire dreaming of being a beggar and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Ignorance is dispelled by knowledge specific to the subject. Just as knowledge about a pot dispels ignorance about it, understanding the true nature of the self eradicates self-ignorance.</p>\n<p>This realization occurs in the minds of those previously ignorant. Krishna likens this transformative knowledge to the rising sun. Just as the sun dispels darkness and illuminates everything around, self-knowledge eradicates self-ignorance and reveals the self as Brahman—a truth previously unknown.</p>\n<p>Understanding the analogy between knowledge and the sun is crucial. Knowledge doesn't illuminate the self for viewing; rather, it dispels ignorance and unveils the inherent truth—the self itself is the light. This knowledge, known as vritti-gyaana, arises as the thought \"I am Brahman - aham brahma asmi\" in the mind. This thought signifies the knowledge that eradicates self-ignorance, revealing the truth about the self being Brahman. \"I am Brahman\" represents the ultimate truth, or tattva, recognized through teachings from scripture.</p>",

Just like rope-snake that will disappear with the wake knowledge of the rope. The snake is <strong>arthaadhyaasa</strong>, error of object. The body which is ishwara's creation is <strong>gyaanaadhyaasa</strong>, error of knowledge. (Even after knowing sun does not move, sun will be seen rising and setting). Similarly physical body will continue to exist till prarabdha lasts. When we say body is ishwara's creation it is not given by him according to his whims and fancies but <strong>in keeping with the law of karma</strong>.<br><br>Explaination - <br><br></em></p>\n<p>The concept is explained that even after attaining spiritual enlightenment or \"gnyana,\" the physical body of an individual, known as the \"jeeva\" body, does not disappear immediately. This is elucidated through the analogy of the rope and the snake.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Creation by Ishwara: According to Vedanta, the physical body is created by Ishwara, the divine aspect of existence. It is viewed as part of the cosmic order and is governed by the laws of karma. Therefore, the body should be allowed to naturally run its course until the end of its predetermined lifespan, known as \"<strong>prarabdha</strong>.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gyanaadhyaasa </strong>and <strong>Arthaadhyaasa</strong>: The persistence of the body even after attaining spiritual enlightenment is explained through the concepts of \"gyanaadhyaasa\" and \"arthaadhyaasa.\" \"Arthaadhyaasa\" refers to the error of object perception, as in mistaking a rope for a snake. In contrast, \"gyanaadhyaasa\" refers to the error of knowledge, where despite knowing the truth, the perception or experience remains unchanged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Example of the Rope-Snake Analogy: Just as the illusion of the snake persists even after realizing the rope's true nature, the physical body continues to exist even after gaining spiritual knowledge. The disappearance of the snake upon realizing the rope represents the resolution of the error of object perception. Similarly, the physical body's existence is seen as a manifestation of the divine order, which continues until the individual's predetermined karma is exhausted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Law of Karma: The creation of the body by Ishwara is not arbitrary but follows the law of karma. Each individual's experiences, including the physical body, are shaped by past actions and karmic debts. Therefore, the body's existence is governed by laws rather than divine whim.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em> </em></p>",

Words are powerful tools for communication, but they have their limitations. Adi Shankara says words can only reveal four specific aspects:<br><br><strong>Jaati</strong>: This refers to the classification or category of a thing. Words can label or classify objects based on their type or category. For example, words can distinguish between different species of animals or types of objects.<br><strong>Guna</strong>: Guna refers to the qualities or attributes of a thing. Words can describe the characteristics or properties of objects, such as their color, size, shape, or texture. By using words, we can convey information about the qualities of things.<br><strong>Kriya</strong>: Kriya pertains to the actions or activities associated with a thing. Words can describe the actions performed by objects or individuals. They can convey information about what something does or how it behaves.<br><strong>Sambandha</strong>: Sambandha refers to the relationship or connection between things. Words can describe the relationships between objects or entities, such as cause and effect, association, or dependency. They can convey information about how things are related to each other.<br>\"<strong>sangya</strong>,\" which refers to the naming or identification of objects, is closely related to \"jaati\" (classification), as it involves categorizing objects by assigning them names or labels. By naming objects, we establish their identity and distinguish them from others, which is an essential function of language. </p>",
